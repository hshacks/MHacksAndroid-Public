MHacksAndroid
=============

The Android MHacks app - open sourced!

Changes to this version of the app may be behind the official app, since the official app contains
private API keys, among other things. Otherwise, it's the same app.

This app was created with [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html), though it should be possible to build it with other IDEs.
